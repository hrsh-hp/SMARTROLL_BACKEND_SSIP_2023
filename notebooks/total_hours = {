total_hours = {

    "ML":5,

    "BDA":5,

    "IS":5,

    "MCWC":3,

    "CC":3,

    "MAD":4,

    "DF":4,

}



above dictionary is the minimum subject hours for each subjects



now the student will have to select any 4 subjects from above subjects so there are total 178 students and each of them will be able to chose 4 subjects so after the students have chosen their subjects here is the student count for each subjects

ML Student Count - 149

BDA Student Count - 29

IS Student Count - 178

MCWC Student Count - 24

CC Student Count - 154

MAD Student Count - 18

DF Student Count - 160



and here is the common subjects groups derived from above choises

{
('ML', 'IS', 'CC', 'DF'):138,
('ML', 'IS', 'CC', 'MAD'):6,
('ML', 'IS', 'MCWC', 'MAD'):2,
('ML', 'IS', 'MCWC', 'DF'):3,
('BDA', 'IS', 'MCWC', 'MAD'):9,
('BDA', 'IS', 'CC', 'DF'):9,
('BDA', 'IS', 'CC', 'MAD'):1,
('BDA', 'IS', 'MCWC', 'DF'):10,
}



which means there are total 138 students who has the same 4 subjects which are ('ML', 'IS', 'CC', 'DF')  and so on for other subject groups



now i want you to make divisions and allocate subject groups in a way that after division allocation subject hours of each subject should be as close as the initial subject hours



for example if you decide to make 2 divisions and add the grop 'BDA', 'IS', 'MCWC', 'MAD') to division 1 and group  ('BDA', 'IS', 'CC', 'MAD') to division be then total hours of BDA will be initial hours * 2 because divisions are to



and also the min student count for 1 division is 60 and maximum count is 90 

you can also split students in 1 group like from this group Group - ('ML', 'IS', 'CC', 'DF') | Student Count 138

90 students can be in division 1 and rest can be in some other division but the main goal of keeping the total hours as close as the initial hours should be satisfied



and the hour is depended on the division not students so if a subject is in multipel grops and those  groups are divided in let's say 2 division then the total hours for that subject will be initial hours * 2
